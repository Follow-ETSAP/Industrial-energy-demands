# Industrial-energy-demands
Global regionalized industrial energy demands for the year 2018

The elaborated dataset contains two main folders: "Production quantities" and "Energy calculations". Additionally, country groups considered under the aggregated TIAM regions are given in file Countries_per_TIAM.csv.
The folder "Production quantities" includes twelve files containing information about the national production quantities per industrial branch and product, grouped by industrial subsector (Iron and steel (IS), Non-ferrous Metals (NF), Non-metallic Minerals (NM), Pulp and Paper (PP), Chemical and petrochemical (CH)).
In the folder "Energy calculations", the first file encompases specific energy demands for production of the above-mentioned industrial products by the Best available technologies (BATs). 
Second file consists of industrial energy demands per branch and production process, grouped by industrial subsector, and calculated considering the BATs. Diversified are electricity and main fuel types (natural gas, oil, coal, and biomass, as well as ethane among the chemical feedstocks). 
Third file includes inefficiency factors per TIAM region and per industrial subsector. It also contains energy demands calculated for the BAT as well as final (recalculated) energy demands, per TIAM region, industrial subsector, branch and process route, for electricity and total fuel.
