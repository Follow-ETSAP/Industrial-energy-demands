# Industrial-energy-demands
Global regionalized industrial energy demands for the year 2018

The elaborated dataset contains two main folders: "Production quantities" and "Energy calculations". Additionally, territories considered under the aggregated TIAM regions are given in file TIAM_regions.csv.
The folder "Production quantities" includes twelve files containing information about national production quantities per industrial branch and product, grouped by industrial subsector (Iron and Steel (IS), Non-Ferrous Metals (NF), Non-Metallic Minerals (NM), Pulp and Paper (PP), Chemical and Petrochemical (CH)).
In the folder "Energy calculations", the first file encompasses specific energy demands for the production of the above-mentioned industrial products by the Best Available Technologies (BATs) and the theoretical minimum energy. 
The Second file consists of regional industrial energy demands per branch and production process, grouped by industrial subsector, and calculated considering the BATs and the theoretical minima. Distinguished are electricity and different main fuel types (for energy use as well as for chemical feedstock). 
The third file includes inefficiency factors (raw and adjusted) per TIAM region and per industrial subsector, for BAT and for the theoretical minimum. It also contains energy demands calculated for the BAT and for the theoretical minimum energy, as well as final (recalculated) energy demands, per TIAM region, industrial subsector, branch and process route, for electricity and total fuel including feedstock.
The fourth file includes validation calculations.
