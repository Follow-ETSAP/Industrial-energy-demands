•	This dataset incorporates a small number of isolated factual values observed on publicly accessible industry webpages (no login/paywall at the time of access). Each page is cited by URL and access date; no tables, charts, or substantial portions of any database are reproduced.
•	Statista values were accessed via TUM’s campus license. Statista’s publication rights allow the use of downloaded statistics in scientific publications with attribution, but do not permit redistribution of substantial portions of the database. We include only a small number of isolated factual values in this dataset, with clear in-text citations (URL) and in-table citations (URL, access date, additional metadata). Where possible, we cite the primary/open data provider instead of Statista.
